            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2012, Rapids began with a simple dream: to share the thrill of whitewater rafting with
                adventure seekers from
                all walks of life. What started as a small group of passionate river guides offering weekend trips along
                local waterways
                soon grew into one of the region’s most trusted names in outdoor adventure.

                Over the years, Rapids has expanded its operations to include multiple rafting routes for all skill
                levels — from calm
                scenic floats to challenging Class V rapids. The company has built a strong reputation for its
                commitment to safety,
                environmental stewardship, and exceptional guest experiences.

                Today, Rapids continues to push forward with the same spirit of adventure that inspired its founding —
                creating
                meaningful connections between people, nature, and the exhilarating power of the river.</p>
